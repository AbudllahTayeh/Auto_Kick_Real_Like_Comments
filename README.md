This is an advanced, AI-powered chat bot for the Kick streaming platform, controlled by a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI). The bot uses Google's Gemini AI to watch the live chat of any streamer, understand the context of the conversation, and generate unique, human-like comments in real-time.

It's designed to be highly resilient and efficient, capable of running for extended periods by intelligently managing API keys and batching requests.

### Core Features

-   **Full Graphical Interface:** No more command lines. Control everything from a clean, intuitive desktop application.
-   **AI-Powered Conversation:** Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate contextually relevant and casual comments.
-   **Dynamic Language & Accent Control:** The AI's personality, language, and accent can be directly controlled via the "Special Request" box in the GUI.
-   **Intelligent Scraping:** Filters out messages from other bots, emojis, and duplicate spam to provide the AI with high-quality context.
-   **API Key Rotation:** Automatically cycles through a list of your Gemini API keys to bypass daily free-tier limits and maximize runtime.
-   **Efficient Batching:** Reduces API usage significantly by generating multiple comments in a single request and using them over several cycles.
-   **Automated Login:** On first run, the bot saves your session cookies for quick, automated logins in the future.
